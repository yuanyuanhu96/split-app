### TripKeeper helps you seamlessly split travel expenses with your friends.

Work in Progress
Updated 9/01/2021

This app is a side project I started recently. The design was inspired by my experience while travel with friends, people are usually overwhelmed by many bills, and need helps with calculation. The front-end part is mainly created with React.js and with Bootstrap. I'm going to build the back-end with node.js.
